# SnakePad

Hello, welcome to my SnakePad project. As someone who has a growing collection of corn snakes, I need a way that was more user friendly and exicitng than a excel spreadsheet. This is a second iteration of the project, re-built from the ground up with logic improvements and better component usage.

## Project Details

Log in using Auth0 is intended, but for demo purposes it's been left out, on the homepage you're greeted to your very own list of snakes.

On this page you can add snakes to your collection, delete them, and just generally have access to high level information on your snakes.

If you click more info you will be sent to the detail page of that particular snake:

On this page you can update the snake's info and add new records using the Add record button.
